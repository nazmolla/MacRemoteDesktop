/// or a single AAC-LC access unit) plus the source-side timestamp in ms,
/// plus the chunk's playback duration in ms. Carried on a dedicated
/// bounded channel separate from the unified `ServerEvent` stream so the
/// server's audio dispatch can run independently of inbound-PDU and
/// outbound-event dispatch, avoiding the multi-second audio starvation
/// that happens when inbound cliprdr chunks monopolize the per-connection
/// `Mutex<Self>` (e.g., during a large `--lazy-paste` Windows→Mac transfer).
///
/// The third element is the chunk's duration in ms, or `None` to have the
/// dispatcher derive it from the byte length assuming uncompressed PCM
/// (`BYTES_PER_MS`). A compressed codec (AAC) MUST set it explicitly: its
/// byte length bears no fixed relationship to playback time, so the
/// PCM-bytes-to-ms assumption in the audio-lag model would collapse.
