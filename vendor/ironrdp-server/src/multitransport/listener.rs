//! (vendored, feature=multitransport) UDP listener + RDPEUDP SYN/SYN+ACK
//! handshake on the wire — **M3b**.
//!
//! Owns a [`tokio::net::UdpSocket`], demultiplexes inbound datagrams by peer
//! address, and drives a per-peer [`RdpeudpState`] (the sans-I/O reliability
//! state machine from `ironrdp-rdpeudp`) through the RDPEUDP handshake: a real
//! client's SYN is answered with a wire-correct SYN+ACK (matching real Windows;
//! see `ironrdp-rdpeudp`'s `Datagram::syn_ack`), negotiating the data version
//! (V3 = RDPEUDP2). The reliability/codec logic lives in `ironrdp-rdpeudp`; this
//! file is purely the I/O layer.
//!
//! # Scope (M3b)
//!
//! - Handshake only: SYN → SYN+ACK, version negotiation, established detection.
//!   No TLS, no MS-RDPEMT tunnel, no channel migration yet (M4/M5), and no data
//!   delivery up to a consumer.
//! - **Cookie validation is soft**: the client's SYNEX `cookieHash` is logged but
//!   not verified against the issued security cookie. This listener produces the
//!   first macrdp↔client capture (our own cookie + the client's resulting hash),
//!   which is what's needed to derive/verify the exact hash formula; strict
//!   binding to a specific TCP session lands in M3c.
//! - Peers are demuxed by source address and **idle-timeout garbage-collected**
//!   (M3c): a peer with no *inbound* datagram for `PEER_IDLE_TIMEOUT_MS` is evicted
//!   by `gc_idle_peers` (its `peers` entry + any `bound_addrs` cookie→addr mapping),
//!   so a dead RDP session's reliability SM stops RTO-retransmitting to a gone client
//!   and the maps don't leak for the process lifetime. The prompt server→listener
//!   "instant retire-on-disconnect" signal is the still-deferred other half of M3c
//!   (the idle GC is the needed backstop regardless).
//!
//! Cross-platform (pure tokio/std networking), so Linux CI exercises it too — see
//! the loopback integration test in the macrdp crate (the vendored server is
//! built `test = false`).
