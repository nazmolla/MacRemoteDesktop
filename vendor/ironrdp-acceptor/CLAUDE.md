# vendor/ironrdp-acceptor — divergence log

Local fork of ironrdp-acceptor 0.10.0, **re-vendored 2026-08-05 from upstream
Devolutions/IronRDP@a5d1c682** (the pin-bump rev). Originally copied 2026-06-12
from @879ffed. connection.rs was refreshed verbatim from a5d1c682 and the surviving
divergences re-applied on top (142 pure additions + 2 intended modifications:
`let mut written`, and `create_gcc_blocks`'s `multi_transport_channel` populate);
lib.rs keeps only the `MultitransportOffer` re-export; finalization.rs keeps only the
channel-skip (upstream unchanged there); channel_connection/credssp/util are byte-
identical to a5d1c682. Has a standalone `[patch]` (core/pdu/svc/connector/async →
a5d1c682) for isolated build, ignored in the macrdp workspace. Keep the rev in sync.

**▶▶▶ STATE AT THE a5d1c682 PIN BUMP (2026-08-05): divergences (1), (2), and the
READ-side of (3) all RETIRED — upstream now provides them.** a5d1c682 carries:
`honor_client_desktop_size: Option<DesktopSize>` (unified honor + #1404 max;
setter `set_honor_client_desktop_size(Option<DesktopSize>)` — so div (1) incl. the
operator ceiling is upstream, #1373+#1404), `keyboard_layout: u32` (div (2), #1397),
`multitransport_flags` on `Acceptor`+`AcceptorResult` (div (3) read-side, #1453),
**AND the MCS message-channel allocation + `SC_MCS_MSGCHANNEL` grant + join**
(`message_channel_id`, allocated when the client sends `CS_MESSAGE_CHANNEL`), plus an
**unconditional `EXTENDED_CLIENT_DATA_SUPPORTED`** advertise. So macrdp's
`advertise_extended_client_data` field ALSO retired (upstream always advertises), as
did macrdp's own message-channel allocation. **What REMAINS vendored: the M3c OFFER
half of (3)** (`multitransport_offer`/`multitransport_offered` + `set_multitransport_offer`,
the `MultitransportOffer` type, the `SC_MULTITRANSPORT` advertise in `create_gcc_blocks`
now gated on `multitransport_offer.is_some()`, the Server-Initiate-Multitransport emit
in `LicensingExchange` riding upstream's `message_channel_id` and gated on upstream's
`multitransport_flags`, and the `CapabilitiesWaitConfirm` + finalization.rs channel-skip)
**+ divergence (4) fingerprint**. The historical divergence notes below are kept for
context; the RETIRED ones were NOT re-applied. Server-fork div-9 (honor-size forward)
+ main.rs must adopt the `set_honor_client_desktop_size(Option<DesktopSize>)` signature
(bool→Option) — a downstream server/src change.

(1) Honor the client's requested desktop size from Client Core Data
    (UPSTREAMED as #1373, MERGED 2026-07-02 — DROP ON PIN BUMP; still vendored
    only because macrdp's pin `879ffed` predates the merge): `Acceptor` gains
    a `honor_client_desktop_size: bool`
    (default false, setter `set_honor_client_desktop_size`, carried across
    `new_deactivation_reactivation`). When set, the
    `BasicSettingsWaitInitial` state reads `gcc_blocks.core.desktop_width/
    desktop_height` — the resolution the client actually asked for (mstsc
    full-screen monitor size, FreeRDP `/size:WxH`) — and, if sane
    (200..=8192 per MS-RDPBCGR), replaces `self.desktop_size` AND patches
    the Bitmap capset in `server_capabilities` (same mutation
    `new_deactivation_reactivation` does) BEFORE the Demand Active is sent.
    The session is thereby negotiated at the client's resolution from the
    start with no deactivation-reactivation resize.

    Why the acceptor and not the server: the client's own requested size is
    ONLY visible in GCC Client Core Data, which upstream parses in
    `BasicSettingsWaitInitial` and discards (only `early_capability_flags`
    is kept). The Confirm Active bitmap capset — what
    `RdpServerDisplay::request_initial_size` receives — is no help:
    conformant clients (verified in FreeRDP's `rdp_apply_bitmap_capability_set`,
    and mstsc behaves the same) overwrite their desktop size with the
    server's Demand Active values and echo those back. And by the time the
    server sees ANY of this, the acceptor has already committed a size in
    Demand Active inside `accept_finalize`.

    Consumed by `vendor/ironrdp-server` divergence (9): `RdpServer::
    set_honor_client_desktop_size` forwards the flag to each connection's
    acceptor; macrdp wires it from the default-on client-resolution
    auto-adopt (`--no-client-resolution` opts out). The server's display
    handler still learns the adopted size through the normal
    `request_initial_size` call, because the client's Confirm Active echo
    now equals the adopted size.

    Upstream status: MERGED as #1373 (2026-07-02) with the builder shape
    (`RdpServerBuilder::with_honor_client_desktop_size` + a helper refactor).
    On the next pin bump past it, delete this divergence and adopt the upstream
    API (main.rs switches the `set_honor_client_desktop_size` setter to the
    builder method). Verified redundant vs upstream/master 2026-07-08. (Follow-up
    #1404 — clamp the honored size to an operator max — is still OPEN.)

    **Extension (2026-07-09): operator ceiling for the honored size**
    (`honor_client_desktop_size_max: Option<DesktopSize>`, setter
    `set_honor_client_desktop_size_max`, carried across
    `new_deactivation_reactivation`). Mirrors upstream PR #1404's semantics
    locally as defense-in-depth: an in-band client request is clamped
    per-dimension to the operator maximum before adoption (an 8192×8192
    request is ~256 MB of BGRA per frame), while an out-of-band (garbage)
    request stays refused outright by the existing 200..=8192 band check on
    the RAW request — the clamp bounds legit requests, it doesn't launder
    garbage. `None` (the default) is byte-identical to the pre-extension
    behavior. Wired from macrdp's `--max-client-size WxH` via the vendored
    server (divergence (9) extension); end-to-end tested in macrdp's
    `src/conn_test.rs` (`client_resolution_clamped_to_operator_max` +
    `operator_max_does_not_touch_in_bounds_request`, a real IronRDP client
    over duplex). On the pin bump past #1404, delete this and pass the max
    through the upstream `Option<DesktopSize>` honor-size API instead.

(2) Expose the client's keyboard-layout id from Client Core Data (UPSTREAMED
    as #1397, MERGED 2026-07-01 — DROP ON PIN BUMP; added 2026-06-16): `Acceptor` gains a private
    `client_keyboard_layout: u32` (captured in `BasicSettingsWaitInitial`
    from `gcc_blocks.core.keyboard_layout`, alongside the size read in (1),
    but UNCONDITIONALLY — it's free and harmless), carried across
    `new_deactivation_reactivation`, and surfaced as a new
    `pub keyboard_layout: u32` field on `AcceptorResult` (0 = not sent).
    Consumed by `vendor/ironrdp-server` divergence (10), which publishes it
    to a shared cell macrdp's input handler reads to auto-select a non-US
    keyboard layout (`src/keyboard_layout.rs`). Purely additive (a new struct
    field + a new private field). Upstreamed as #1397 (MERGED 2026-07-01, same
    `AcceptorResult` field shape); drop on the next pin bump past it. Verified
    redundant vs upstream/master 2026-07-08. See the keyboard-layout quirk note
    in docs/known-quirks.md.

(3) Expose the client's multitransport (MS-RDPEMT) support flags from its GCC
    MultiTransportChannelData block. **The READ-side (surfacing the flags on
    `AcceptorResult`) is MERGED as #1453 (2026-07-30, by mamoreau-devolutions) — a
    line-for-line twin of the merged #1397/#1373 GCC-surfacing; drop it from this
    fork on the pin bump past its merge. The M3c advertise/emit/offer half below stays
    vendored (macrdp UDP-offer policy), so #1453 does NOT de-vendor the
    acceptor.** Added 2026-06-25 for UDP
    multitransport M1: `Acceptor` gains a private
    `client_multitransport: gcc::MultiTransportFlags` (captured in
    `BasicSettingsWaitInitial` alongside (1)/(2), UNCONDITIONALLY — free and
    harmless; empty if the client sent no block), carried across
    `new_deactivation_reactivation`, and surfaced as a new
    `pub multitransport_flags: gcc::MultiTransportFlags` field on
    `AcceptorResult`. Upstream parses the block into
    `ClientGccBlocks.multi_transport_channel` and then discards it (only
    early-capability flags, core size, and keyboard layout are kept). Consumed
    by `vendor/ironrdp-server` divergence (12), which decides whether to send a
    Server Initiate Multitransport Request. Purely additive (same shape as (2)),
    so trivially upstreamable — offer alongside (1)/(2). See the
    docs/rdp-udp-multitransport-feasibility.md plan.

    M3c (2026-06-25): the acceptor now also *advertises* and *emits* the
    multitransport offer, not just surfaces the client's flags. Four additions,
    all gated on the offer being set (so the default build is unchanged):
    - **`advertise_extended_client_data: bool`** (setter
      `set_advertise_extended_client_data`): when set, the X.224 Negotiation
      Response carries `EXTENDED_CLIENT_DATA_SUPPORTED`. Load-bearing —
      WITHOUT it mstsc omits ALL optional GCC client blocks (CS_MULTITRANSPORT,
      CS_MCS_MSGCHANNEL, CS_MONITOR), so the server never sees UDP support.
    - **`multitransport_offer: Option<MultitransportOffer>`** (setter
      `set_multitransport_offer`; `MultitransportOffer { request_id, protocol,
      cookie }` is a new pub type, re-exported from `lib.rs`). When set, the
      server's GCC Connect Response echoes **SC_MULTITRANSPORT**
      (`MultiTransportChannelData`) AND grants an **SC_MCS_MSGCHANNEL**
      (`ServerMessageChannelData`) with an allocated MCS message channel id
      (= io_channel + channel_count + 1, e.g. 1008). The message channel is a
      hard requirement: clients route the bootstrap/autodetect PDUs by
      `messageChannelId` and ignore an Initiate Request on the I/O channel
      (FreeRDP logs `expected messageChannelId=1008, got 1003`).
    - **Emit the Server Initiate Multitransport Request in `LicensingExchange`**
      — after the licensing PDU, BEFORE Demand Active, on the message channel.
      This is the ONLY window clients honor it (FreeRDP's
      MULTITRANSPORT_BOOTSTRAPPING_REQUEST state, between LICENSING and
      DEMAND_ACTIVE; mstsc the same). Sent post-finalization (the original M1
      shape, on the I/O channel from the server crate) the client is ACTIVE and
      misreads it as a share-control PDU and tears the session down. The issued
      offer is recorded on `multitransport_offered: Option<MultitransportOffer>`
      (new `AcceptorResult` field) so the server can build its MigrationState.
    - **Finalization channel-skip** (`finalization.rs` + `CapabilitiesWaitConfirm`
      in `connection.rs`): once a message channel exists, the client interleaves
      PDUs on it — notably its **Client Initiate Multitransport Response**
      (E_ABORT when it can't bring up UDP, or simply when it falls back) —
      with the io-channel finalization PDUs. Both decode sites blindly decoded
      the next `SendDataRequest`'s payload as a `ShareControlHeader`, so a
      message-channel PDU killed the session with `invalid pdu_type` during
      `accept_finalize`. Fix: skip any `SendDataRequest` whose `channel_id` !=
      the io channel and stay in the same state. (Strictly more correct than the
      old behaviour even ignoring multitransport: `WaitSynchronize`/
      `WaitControlCooperate` previously swallowed a decode error AND advanced,
      which would desync.) Verified live: FreeRDP + mstsc both reach ACTIVE and
      render; mstsc additionally completes the RDPEUDP SYN→SYN+ACK handshake on
      the wire (see server divergence (12) M3c). **Cookie finding:** mstsc
      negotiates RDPEUDP **V2**, where the 16-byte security cookie is NOT in the
      SYN (the SYN `cookieHash` is V3/RDPEUDP2 only) — it rides the MS-RDPEMT
      `RDP_TUNNEL_CREATEREQUEST`, so strict cookie binding is an M4 concern.

    P2.0 spike (2026-06-26): the `SC_MULTITRANSPORT` advertise at
    `BasicSettingsSendResponse` now emits the flag MATCHING the offer's protocol
    (`UDP_FECL` when `self.multitransport_offer.protocol == UdpFecL`, else
    `UDP_FECR`) instead of hardcoding `UDP_FECR` — the advertised type and the
    Initiate Request must agree. Default offer is still reliable; lossy is the
    env-gated spike (`MACRDP_UDP_OFFER_FECL=1`). Verified GREEN on real mstsc: it
    advertises `UDP_FECR|UDP_FECL|UDP_PREFERRED|SOFT_SYNC`, accepts the `UdpFecL`
    Initiate Request, opens a `SYN_LOSSY` flow, and starts a **DTLS 1.2**
    handshake. See docs/rdp-udp-multitransport-feasibility.md → "P2.0 Result".

(4) Client-fingerprint identity fields from GCC Client Core Data (NOT upstreamed;
    added 2026-07-18): `Acceptor` gains private `client_name: String` /
    `client_version: u32` (raw `RdpVersion.0`) / `client_build: u32`, captured in
    `BasicSettingsWaitInitial` alongside the KLID (divergence (2)) and surfaced as
    `pub` fields on `AcceptorResult` (name cloned, not taken, so a
    deactivation–reactivation's result still carries it). Consumed by the vendored
    server's divergence (20) client-fingerprint log. Same additive GCC-surfacing
    shape as (2) KLID/#1397 and the #1453 multitransport flags → cleanly
    upstreamable later. Heuristics: mstsc sends the real Windows build (e.g.
    22621) + its hostname; FreeRDP hardcodes build 2600. Informational
    fingerprinting only — a client can claim anything.
