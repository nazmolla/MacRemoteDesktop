Useful CLI flags (see `src/main.rs::Args` for the full set):
```
--bind 0.0.0.0:3390       # listen address
--username NAME           # default: $USER
--password PASS           # avoid the interactive prompt (logs are warned)
--skip-auth               # bypass PAM (also skips password validation)
--width  / --height       # override autodetected display size
--hidpi                   # capture the primary display at backing (Retina) pixels
                          #   instead of logical points (~4x pixels; crisp; best
                          #   with --enable-h264). Ignored with --width/--height
                          #   or --virtual-display. macOS-only. Also disables live
                          #   client-driven resize (a resized client window is
                          #   silently ignored) — resize needs the client-resolution
                          #   auto-adopt path, which --hidpi pins off, same as it
                          #   pins the initial connect-time size.
--fps N                   # default 60 with --enable-h264, else 15
--cursor-scale MULT       # pointer size multiplier (default 1.0 = native macOS
                          #   size, hotspot-exact). Bump (e.g. 1.5/2.0) if your
                          #   client upscales the desktop but draws the pointer
                          #   at native pixels, making it look small.
--keyboard-layout SPEC    # Force a non-US layout (name like `french`/`de`/
                          #   `azerty`, a Windows KLID like 0x040C, or a macOS
                          #   input-source id) instead of auto-detecting from the
                          #   client. `none` disables translation. Keys are
                          #   translated via UCKeyTranslate and posted as Unicode;
                          #   the Mac's own input source is untouched. The layout
                          #   must be installed on the Mac. Auto-detect is the
                          #   default (no flag needed). macOS-only.
--map-ctrl-to-cmd         # Remap Windows editing shortcuts (Ctrl+C/V/X/A/Z/S/F/
                          #   N/T/W/O/P/R/G, + Shift variants) to their Cmd
                          #   equivalents so Windows muscle memory drives macOS
                          #   copy/paste. Off by default (Q excluded; nav keys
                          #   untouched). Auto-suppressed when a terminal is
                          #   frontmost so Ctrl+C stays SIGINT. macOS-only.
--no-remap-apps LIST      # Comma-separated bundle ids where --map-ctrl-to-cmd is
                          #   suppressed, on top of the built-in terminal list —
                          #   for editors with an embedded terminal that can't be
                          #   auto-detected (e.g. com.microsoft.VSCode). macOS-only.
--no-client-resolution    # Don't adopt the resolution the client requests at
                          #   connect (the auto-adopt default). Auto-adopt
                          #   applies on the mirror-primary path when no
                          #   --width/--height/--hidpi is given, AND on
                          #   --virtual-display (the vd is re-moded to the
                          #   client's size; --width/--height are its initial
                          #   size, not a pin). With this flag the session is
                          #   served at the startup-resolved size (native
                          #   display size, or the --width/--height vd size)
                          #   and live client-driven resize is disabled too —
                          #   it rides the same auto-adopt gate.
--stretch                 # On the auto-size path, fill the client frame instead
                          #   of the default aspect-preserving letterbox/pillarbox.
                          #   No effect with --width/--height or matching aspect.
--max-client-size WxH     # Cap the resolution a client can request on the
                          #   auto-adopt path (defense-in-depth resource bound;
                          #   e.g. 2560x1440 — without it a client can request up
                          #   to the protocol max 8192x8192 ≈ 256 MB of BGRA per
                          #   frame). Requests above the cap are clamped
                          #   per-dimension. Each dimension must be in [200,
                          #   8192]. No effect off the auto-adopt path. Config:
                          #   MAX_CLIENT_SIZE. Mirrors upstream IronRDP #1404.
--shield-primary          # Third headless blanking mechanism, alternative to
                          #   --detach-primary / --capture-primary (mutually
                          #   exclusive with both; needs --virtual-display).
                          #   Covers every physical panel with an opaque BLACK
                          #   WINDOW drawn by the bundled macrdpshield helper
                          #   instead of gamma-blacking a captured display.
                          #   Two wins over --capture-primary:
                          #     (1) the Mac CAN STILL BE LOCKED. capture-primary
                          #         silently prevents locking (loginwindow can't
                          #         draw onto a CGDisplayCapture'd display), so a
                          #         capture-primary Mac is physically unsecured.
                          #     (2) no ~250 ms desktop flash on a live client
                          #         resize — a window survives a display
                          #         reconfiguration, whereas macOS RESETS gamma
                          #         on one (that flash is unfixable with gamma).
                          #   Trade-off: without the capture the local pointer is
                          #   NOT confined, so a person at the machine can move it
                          #   and disturb the remote cursor. Their clicks are
                          #   swallowed by the shield; their keystrokes go where
                          #   focus already was (capture never blocked the
                          #   keyboard either, so that part is unchanged).
                          #   STATUS: the Mac locks AND the lock screen is
                          #   visible (live-verified) — by default it keeps the
                          #   PHYSICAL panel main so loginwindow draws the lock
                          #   there. COST (2nd-machine-confirmed): the
                          #   remote desktop then has NO menu bar / Dock (they
                          #   stay on the shielded physical panel) — usable via
                          #   Ctrl+Alt+G to gather windows onto the visible vd.

                          #   Fail-safe, precisely: a MISSING helper binary aborts
                          #   startup. An UNREACHABLE helper at connect time only
                          #   warns — the session proceeds with the desktop
                          #   visible. SHOW/HIDE are acknowledged (the helper
                          #   replies with the count it actually covered) and the
                          #   mode refuses to engage if that is short, so the
                          #   failure is at least detected. If the helper dies
                          #   mid-session the panel becomes visible and nothing
                          #   restarts it.
                          #   SINGLE-PANEL hardware (a MacBook with no external
                          #   display): macOS auto-mirrors the vd onto the
                          #   built-in panel, so on connect the mode BREAKS that
                          #   mirror (process-scoped; auto-reverts on crash,
                          #   restored on disconnect — and on a failed engage)
                          #   and moves the panel aside so app windows land on
                          #   the display the client sees. Side effects there:
                          #   the vd becomes the system main display (lock-
                          #   while-shielded is UNVERIFIED on this hardware),
                          #   and when the vd is larger than the panel the Dock
                          #   + menu bar land on the vd — so the remote gets
                          #   them despite keep-physical-main. See the shield

Auth hardening (env-only, **on by default**). macrdp rate-limits and briefly
(escalating) locks out source IPs that hammer the port with connection attempts,
in front of the existing NLA/CredSSP gate, and writes a per-connection audit line.
**Loopback (`127.0.0.1`/`::1`) is always exempt** — these only bite when `--bind`
exposes the server to other hosts, and you can't lock yourself out locally. The
defaults are conservative; tune or disable via env (settable through `config.env`
— see the matching keys there — or the LaunchAgent plist `EnvironmentVariables`):
```
MACRDP_CONN_GUARD=1               # master switch (0/off = disable rate-limit + lockout)
MACRDP_AUDIT_LOG=1                # connection audit log (independent of the guard)
MACRDP_GUARD_RL_MAX=10            # max attempts per window per IP (0 = no rate-limit)
MACRDP_GUARD_RL_WINDOW_SECS=60    # rate-limit sliding window
MACRDP_GUARD_FAIL_THRESHOLD=5     # consecutive failures before lockout (0 = no lockout)
MACRDP_GUARD_FAILFAST_SECS=3      # only errored connections that fail within this window (pre-handshake) count toward lockout
MACRDP_GUARD_COOLDOWN_BASE_SECS=30  # first lockout length (doubles per extra failure)
MACRDP_GUARD_COOLDOWN_MAX_SECS=900  # lockout escalation cap (15 min)
```
The lockout **escalates and auto-expires** — duration `COOLDOWN_BASE << (failures −
threshold)`, capped at `COOLDOWN_MAX`. With the defaults it triggers at the 5th
consecutive failure and doubles from 30 s as the IP keeps failing past each cooldown:

| Consecutive failures | Lockout |
|---|---|
| 5 (threshold) | 30 s |
| 6 | 60 s |
| 7 | 120 s |
| 8 | 240 s |
| 9 | 480 s |
| 10+ | 900 s (capped) |

There is **no manual unlock** — each cooldown auto-expires, then the next attempt is
allowed through. Escalation requires *actually failing again after* each cooldown
clears (while locked out, attempts are rejected pre-handshake and don't count as new
failures), and **a clean session — or any connection that got past the handshake —
resets the IP to 0**. The lockout is **heuristic**: only a connection that errored
*and* failed within the fail-fast window (`MACRDP_GUARD_FAILFAST_SECS`, ~3s — i.e.
never authenticated, the brute-force signature) counts as a failure. A client that
connected for several seconds and *then* errored (e.g. mstsc's reconnect-blank or a
flaky link) is treated as legitimate and does **not** accrue toward a lockout — so a
reconnecting real client is never locked out, and a single benign disconnect (mstsc's
first-connect cert-prompt "Broken pipe") never does either. Audit lines are tagged
`macrdp::audit`: `grep 'macrdp::audit' ~/Library/Logs/macrdp.log` shows
`event="accept|reject|disconnect"` with the source IP and (for rejects) the reason
and retry-after.

Health-check watchdog (env-only; **on by default when headless**). Detects a
**hung-but-alive** process — the tokio runtime deadlocked / all workers blocked —
and exits (code 70) so the LaunchAgent `KeepAlive` restarts a fresh one.
`KeepAlive` alone only restarts on an outright
crash, not a wedge; this closes that gap. It's armed on the long-lived
launchd-watched serve process and **skipped**, by default, **interactively**
(stdout is a TTY,
e.g. `cargo run` — a false bounce there would just kill a dev session, and nothing
would restart it). Defaults are conservative — a wedge must persist ~90 s before a
bounce, so load spikes never trip it. Tune / force / disable via env (or the
matching `config.env` keys):
```
MACRDP_HEALTHCHECK=1                 # force on (even interactive); 0/off = disable
MACRDP_HEALTHCHECK_INTERVAL_SECS=15  # delay between liveness probes
MACRDP_HEALTHCHECK_TIMEOUT_SECS=30   # max time a probe may take before it's a miss
MACRDP_HEALTHCHECK_FAILURES=2        # consecutive misses before the process exits
```
The mechanism: a dedicated OS thread (not a tokio task, so it keeps ticking even
when the runtime it watches is wedged) submits a trivial probe onto the runtime
each interval and waits `TIMEOUT_SECS` for it to run; a deadlocked runtime never
runs it. A bounce logs `health-check watchdog: tokio runtime wedged …` before
exiting.

Blank recovery + auto-reconnect (env-tunable, **settable through `config.env`**
— the matching keys are the same names minus the `MACRDP_` prefix, e.g.
`BLANK_RECOVERY=0`; on by default with `--enable-h264`).
The mstsc reconnect-blank auto-heal now **reactivates the RDP core in place** —
on a detected blank the server sends a bare Deactivation–Reactivation (Server
Deactivate All → new Demand Active) that preserves the EGFX channel/surface, and
mstsc re-maps its retained surface and presents again with NO disconnect
(live-verified: 5/5 blanks healed EDR=0 → presenting in ~1-2 s, zero drops). This
is the default first action; a drop is the fallback only if the reactivation ever
fails to heal. Detection is link-aware (RTT-gated) and has a wall-clock fast-path
so a static blank heals in ~4 s (see the blank-recovery notes in
`docs/known-quirks.md`):
```
MACRDP_BLANK_RECOVERY=1                # 0 disables the detector entirely
MACRDP_BLANK_RECOVERY_REACTIVATE=1     # 1 = reactivate-in-place (heals mstsc); 0 = fall back to drop
MACRDP_BLANK_RECOVERY_MAX_RTT_MS=80    # withhold recovery at/above this link RTT (0 = no gate)
MACRDP_BLANK_RECOVERY_MIN_QOE=24       # all-zero QoE reports for the count path (~3 s of active decode) — never/barely-presented sessions only; an ESTABLISHED session uses ESTABLISHED_MIN_QOE instead
MACRDP_BLANK_RECOVERY_MIN_RENDER_REPORTS=3  # CONSECUTIVE nonzero decode+render reports that count as "presenting" and disarm the detector (a shorter blip doesn't, and a lapse back to zero re-arms it)
MACRDP_BLANK_RECOVERY_ESTABLISHED_REPORTS=40  # nonzero reports (~5 s) that mark a session ESTABLISHED/healthy; above this a relapse needs the long window below, not the aggressive MIN_QOE
MACRDP_BLANK_RECOVERY_ESTABLISHED_MIN_QOE=160  # all-zero reports (~20 s at the active cadence) required to recover an ESTABLISHED session — tolerates the brief zero-EDR windows a healthy client produces (a shorter window dropped a working 12-min session)
MACRDP_BLANK_RECOVERY_ESTABLISHED_MAX_WAIT_MS=30000  # wall-clock companion to the above: an established session is also declared blank once NOTHING nonzero has arrived for this long (with the report floor below) — bounds recovery on a STATIC blank, where QoE trickles at ~0.3/s and the 160-report count alone would take ~9 min
MACRDP_BLANK_RECOVERY_ESTABLISHED_WALL_REPORTS=16  # consecutive zeros the wall-clock branch needs — proves the client is still decoding, so an IDLE session (no frames, no QoE at all) never trips it
MACRDP_BLANK_RECOVERY_MAX_WAIT_MS=4000 # wall-clock fast-path: fire after this on a static blank (never-established sessions only)
MACRDP_BLANK_RECOVERY_MIN_WALL_REPORTS=1  # min all-zero reports the fast-path needs (rules out QoE-less clients)
MACRDP_BLANK_RECOVERY_HEAL_CONFIRM_MS=8000  # post-attempt heal-confirmation deadline (0 disables): once a recovery attempt has run, the session must show a SUSTAINED nonzero-EDR run within this long or the next attempt (the fallback drop) fires — on cumulative-zero / total-silence evidence that interleaved phantom nonzero reports can't reset (Windows App for macOS starved the consecutive-zero paths for 12+ s live, 2026-07-23)
MACRDP_BLANK_RECOVERY_ARM_MS=3000      # skip the connect-time churn window
MACRDP_BLANK_RECOVERY_RETRY_MS=4000    # spacing between attempts
MACRDP_BLANK_RECOVERY_MAX_ATTEMPTS=1   # forced to >=2 when REACTIVATE=1 so the fallback drop can fire
MACRDP_BLANK_RECOVERY_MAX_CONSECUTIVE_DROPS=3  # reconnect-storm guard (0 = uncapped; only the drop fallback counts)
MACRDP_AUTO_RECONNECT=1                # 0 = don't provision the auto-reconnect cookie (only the drop fallback needs it)
```

Testing against the server:
```bash
# FreeRDP — easiest to script and get verbose logs from.
xfreerdp /v:127.0.0.1:3390 /u:$USER /cert:ignore /log-level:DEBUG

# Microsoft Remote Desktop / Windows App.app — closest to real-user UX.
# Windows mstsc: just enter the computer and click Connect — NLA/CredSSP
# is enabled, mstsc will prompt for credentials in its own dialog.
# Expect one "Broken pipe" error in the log on the first attempt: that's
# mstsc's cert-trust prompt closing and reopening the socket. The next
# attempt succeeds.
```

When iterating on the capture/encode path, prefer FreeRDP with `/log-level:DEBUG` — its PDU traces are far more useful than mstsc's silent failures.

To decrypt a Wireshark capture of a session, run macrdp with `SSLKEYLOGFILE=/path/to/keylog.txt`
and point Wireshark at that file (Preferences → Protocols → TLS → "(Pre)-Master-Secret log
filename"). Covers the TCP RDP connection and the reliable-UDP multitransport flow (rustls);
the lossy flow's DTLS is not covered. macrdp warns loudly at startup while the var is set —
session keys on disk break the capture's confidentiality, so use it only for protocol debugging.
