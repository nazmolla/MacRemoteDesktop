# Architecture

```
src/main.rs       CLI, TCC preflight, TLS cert mgmt, RdpServer assembly
src/auth.rs       Startup PAM auth against the macOS account (libpam FFI)
src/auth_guard.rs Connection-level auth hardening (Tier 1.2): per-source-IP
                  rate-limiting + escalating auto-expiring lockout + a greppable
                  `macrdp::audit` log, in front of the NLA/CredSSP gate. Pure,
                  platform-independent AuthGuardCore (decide/record_outcome, time
                  passed in for deterministic tests) + the ConnectionHandler
                  adapter (AuthGuardHandler) for the single-process serve path.
                  On by default, loopback-exempt, env-tunable (MACRDP_CONN_GUARD /
                  MACRDP_GUARD_* / MACRDP_AUDIT_LOG), zero vendored divergence
                  (reuses ironrdp-server's existing ConnectionHandler seam).
                  Lockout is heuristic (errored/short ⇒ failure, clean long
                  session resets) so a benign disconnect never locks anyone out.
src/capture.rs    ScreenCaptureKit → BgrA32 BitmapUpdate, dirty-rect driven
src/cursor.rs     NSCursor → RGBAPointer, hashed for change detection
src/input.rs      RDP scancodes/mouse PDUs → CGEvent synthesis (US ANSI by
                  default; non-US via src/keyboard_layout.rs),
                  per-side modifier state with NX_DEVICE bits, Caps Lock
                  toggle, AX-driven symbolic-hotkey workarounds
                  (Cmd+Tab app cycle, Cmd+` window cycle, Spotlight,
                  screencapture) since WindowServer's symbolic-hotkey
                  dispatcher won't fire for CGEventPost. The Cmd+Tab cycle
                  (also Option+Tab with --alt-tab-switch), and the Cmd+`
                  window cycle (also Option+` with --alt-backtick-switch),
                  make the landing app always surface — un-minimize / reopen-windowless
                  (open -b) / unhide, gated to the committed app — and, with
                  --app-switcher-hud, drives the macrdphud overlay via
                  src/switcher_hud.rs. Also the optional Ctrl→Cmd
                  Windows-shortcut remap (--map-ctrl-to-cmd): rewrites a
                  curated key set Ctrl+<k>→Cmd+<k> (post_ctrl_as_cmd),
                  suppressed when a terminal / --no-remap-apps app is
                  frontmost. Frontmost detection merges three last-wins
                  signals into LAST_FOCUS_BUNDLE — an NSWorkspace
                  activation observer (init_focus_observer, on the
                  runloop_thread), a mouse-down AX hit-test
                  (update_focus_from_click, AXUIElementCopyElementAtPosition),
                  and the AX MRU poll — because Electron apps take key
                  focus without activating.
src/switcher_hud.rs  App-switcher HUD IPC client (--app-switcher-hud). A bg
                  thread pushes SHOW/ADVANCE/HIDE (opcode+len framing, like
                  the smart-card bridge) over loopback to the macrdphud helper,
                  best-effort/non-blocking (try_send) so the input path never
                  stalls. input.rs calls it from cycle_apps/commit_cycle_session;
                  main.rs auto-spawns the helper + sets the captured display id.
                  The helper itself is gui/Sources/macrdphud/main.swift (a 2nd
                  SwiftPM target alongside the menu-bar controller): a borderless
                  non-activating NSPanel drawing an app-icon row that
                  ScreenCaptureKit captures, so the remote sees the switcher.
                  Cross-platform stub-free (pure std on the Rust side).
gui/Sources/macrdpcamera  The "macrdp Camera" CoreMediaIO Camera SYSTEM EXTENSION
                  (CMIOExtension, macOS 12.3+) — a 3rd SwiftPM target, and the piece
                  that makes camera redirection (src/camera/) visible to apps. One
                  virtual device with a .source stream (what Photo Booth/Zoom select)
                  and a .sink stream (what macrdp's feed.rs writes into); a consume
                  loop forwards sink buffers onto the source, falling back to a test
                  pattern while no producer is feeding. Both streams advertise 420v to
                  match the decoder — CMIO does NOT transcode, so an advertised format
                  that differs from the buffers sent renders garbage. Hand-assembled
                  into a .systemextension bundle by packaging/make-camera-extension.sh
                  (NO Xcode), signed + notarized, embedded in macrdpController.app and
                  activated once via OSSystemExtensionRequest (see
                  gui/Sources/macrdptray/CameraExtension.swift). Runs under a role
                  account, so its os_log is invisible without sudo. Setup + the four
                  SILENT CMIO failure modes: docs/camera-extension-setup.md.
src/keyboard_layout.rs  Optional non-US layout translation
                  (--keyboard-layout). Resolves a name/KLID/input-source-id
                  to a macOS UCKeyboardLayout via TIS and translates
                  (keycode + mods) → Unicode with UCKeyTranslate, so input.rs
                  posts the right character for non-US clients WITHOUT changing
                  the Mac's active input source. Cmd/Ctrl combos stay on the
                  keycode path; dead keys compose via UCKeyTranslate state.
                  macOS-only (Carbon); the translatable-key set + spec parsing
                  are platform-independent and unit-tested.
src/rdpdr/        RDPDR drive redirection — the macrdp side of the server-side
                  RDPDR static channel (--enable-drive-redirection, opt-in,
                  read-write). The protocol state machine (handshake + device
                  discovery) lives in the vendored ironrdp-server::rdpdr; this
                  module is the MacRdpdr factory + RdpdrServerHandler backend.
                  1a: handshake + drive discovery. 1b: device I/O — the backend
                  browses/reads/writes the client drive via RdpdrHandle
                  (list_dir/read_file/write_file/create/remove/rename, matched
                  by a completion-id router in the vendored server; file
                  read/write reuse an LRU kept-open handle cache so sequential
                  transfers don't re-open per chunk). Surface
                  (Phase 2, surface.rs): a real NFS mount. RdpdrFs implements
                  nfsserve's NFSFileSystem over RdpdrHandle (list_dir/read_file,
                  with a path<->fileid cache); an in-process NFSv3 server is
                  mounted via the built-in mount_nfs (no root, no kext) so the
                  client's drive is a proper Finder volume with lazy subdir
                  navigation. Read-write: NFS write/create/mkdir/remove/rename/
                  setattr map to RDPDR DeviceWrite / DeviceCreate /
                  SetInformation. Each redirected filesystem device gets its own
                  mount (MacRdpdrHandler keeps a HashMap<device_id, Surface>).
                  Surface::Drop unmounts on disconnect. smartcard.rs: the
                  smart-card bridge (--enable-smartcard-redirection). When a
                  Smartcard device is announced, binds 127.0.0.1:40242 and serves
                  macrdp's own PC/SC IFD handler (ifd-handler/ cdylib, loaded by
                  com.apple.ifdreader), mapping its POWER_ON/OFF/TRANSMIT/PRESENCE
                  protocol to RdpdrHandle::scard_* (MS-RDPESC) calls on the
                  client's reader. Presence cached briefly; dropped on disconnect.
ifd-handler/      Standalone cdylib (NOT in the macrdp cargo package) — macrdp's
                  PC/SC IFD handler, the IFDHandler v3.0 C ABI macOS
                  SmartCardServices loads. Bridges every card op to macrdp over
                  loopback TCP (src/rdpdr/smartcard.rs). From scratch (MIT/Apache)
                  so smart-card redirection ships no GPL vpcd. Built + embedded in
                  macrdp.app by packaging/; installed by install-ifd-handler.sh.
src/clipboard.rs  CLIPRDR ↔ NSPasteboard (CF_UNICODETEXT + CF_DIB
                  + Mac↔Windows file copy via FileGroupDescriptorW
                  and FileContentsRequest streaming)
src/file_promise.rs  Windows→Mac EAGER download to /tmp + NSPasteboard
                     publish + Glass-chime auto-paste into Finder.
                     Default path; provides fetch_one_file (Arc<File>+
                     pwrite chunk fan-out) reused by the lazy path.
src/file_promise_lazy.rs  Windows→Mac LAZY paste (default; opt out
                          with --no-lazy-paste): pre-
                          sized empty temp file per leaf + one
                          NSFilePresenter each via NSFileCoordinator;
                          on Finder Cmd-V, relinquishPresentedItemToReader:
                          blocks while we fetch_one_file with
                          LAZY_PARALLEL_CHUNKS (2, vs eager's 8) so RDP
                          input stays responsive during the download.
                          macOS shows native "Preparing to paste" progress;
                          no Glass chime / auto-Cmd-V needed.
                          cleanup_on_disconnect drains presenters + temp
                          dir on Drop(MacCliprdrBackend); shutdown_cleanup
                          does the same via a process-global handle for
                          signal exit (which bypasses Drop).
src/runloop_thread.rs  Dedicated CFRunLoop-hosting std::thread with a
                       submit(closure) API. Exists because tokio owns
                       macrdp's main thread (no pumped runloop), and
                       NSFileCoordinator.addFilePresenter / removeFilePresenter
                       calls must land on a thread with a pumped CFRunLoop
                       to deliver presenter callbacks. Wakes via a custom
                       CFRunLoopSource; one shared thread for the process
                       lifetime, started lazily on first submit().
src/audio.rs      RDPSND ← second SCK stream with system-audio capture,
                  rubato 48→44.1 kHz resample, latency-bounded. Ships raw
                  PCM by default, or AAC-LC via src/aac.rs (--enable-aac).
                  Capture loop self-heals a dead SCK stream: rebuilds the
                  SCStream with capped exponential backoff (250 ms→5 s) on
                  start failure OR mid-stream end (the async stream yielding
                  None), instead of going silent for the rest of the session;
                  backoff resets on the first delivered sample. The 'reconnect
                  outer loop preserves my_gen, so the generation guard still
                  retires it on client reconnect (no double-capture).
src/aac.rs        AudioToolbox AAC-LC encoder (--enable-aac). AudioConverter
                  FFI: interleaved i16 PCM → raw AAC access units for the
                  WAVE_FORMAT_AAC_MS RDPSND path. macOS-only.
src/virtual_display/    Opt-in headless display via undocumented
  mod.rs                CGVirtualDisplay* private API. Public Rust
  private_api.rs        surface is `VirtualDisplay::new(w,h,hz)` +
                        display_id/origin_pts/size_pts; ALL touches to
                        private Obj-C classes/symbols are confined to
                        private_api.rs (the maintenance boundary —
                        when Apple changes the API in a future macOS,
                        update only that file).
src/h264.rs       EGFX/H.264 video pipeline (opt-in via --enable-h264).
                  Bridges the VideoToolbox encoder (src/videotoolbox.rs) to
                  upstream's GraphicsPipelineServer: per SCK frame, encode →
                  non-blocking drain → AVC420 (Annex-B framing) → DRDYNVC →
                  ServerEvent::Egfx. Uses upstream's auto-allocated surface id
                  (see the mstsc reconnect-blank quirk note below). Falls back
                  to legacy BitmapUpdate for clients that don't advertise
                  AVC420 decode.
src/videotoolbox.rs  VideoToolbox H.264 encoder (AVCC NALs + SPS/PPS).
                  Feeds VT a full-range BT.709 NV12 (420f) buffer it builds
                  from the captured BGRA — VT would otherwise emit video-range
                  YUV, which mstsc renders washed-out. The BGRA→NV12 conversion
                  is vImage (Accelerate/NEON) accelerated, ~24-32x over the
                  scalar reference kept as a fallback + benchmark baseline.
src/multitransport.rs  macrdp-side RDP UDP multitransport provider
                  (--enable-udp-multitransport, feature `multitransport`,
                  default OFF). Thin: a MacMultitransport that tells the
                  vendored server to offer reliable UDP (UdpFecR). The transport
                  itself (RDPEUDP state machine + RDPEUDP2/EMT codecs) is the
                  sans-I/O vendor/ironrdp-rdpeudp crate; the UDP listener + rustls
                  TLS + MS-RDPEMT tunnel + DYNVC Soft-Sync EGFX migration live in
                  vendored ironrdp-server (src/multitransport/, divergence (12))
                  + vendored ironrdp-dvc (Soft-Sync codec). main.rs binds the
                  listener on the TCP address/port and wires the cookie registry +
                  the server↔listener tunnel handoff. EGFX-over-UDP rendering is
                  additionally env-gated by MACRDP_UDP_MIGRATE_EGFX until soaked.
                  Cross-platform (pure protocol policy); byte-exact Soft-Sync +
                  cookie-registry + Initiate-Request tests live here (the vendored
                  crates are test=false). See docs/rdp-udp-multitransport-
                  feasibility.md.
src/logging.rs    Tracing sink + size-based log rotation. By default stdout
                  (interactive). When headless (stdout not a TTY, e.g. under the
                  LaunchAgent) or given --log-dir/LOG_DIR, writes a self-owned,
                  size-bounded rotating file at ~/Library/Logs/macrdp.log — stable
                  live name (the GUI reads it + scans for "panicked") rotating
                  logrotate-style to macrdp.log.1..N (MACRDP_LOG_MAX_BYTES /
                  MACRDP_LOG_MAX_FILES). Custom (not tracing-appender, which only
                  does dated files; non_blocking was reverted) BLOCKING writer via
                  a MakeWriter over Arc<Mutex<Rotator>>. On the file path it also
                  installs a panic hook that routes panics through tracing into
                  macrdp.log (observability only — cleanup is the reaper's job).
                  The plist drops StandardOutPath (the binary owns the file) and
                  points StandardErrorPath at a small macrdp.err.log.
src/reaper.rs     Startup reaper — on launch, sweeps leftovers from a PRIOR macrdp
                  that died uncleanly (SIGKILL/panic/power-loss skip Drop AND the
                  signal handler): stale NFS mounts + $TMPDIR/macrdp-rdpdr-<pid>/
                  and macrdp-{paste,lazy-paste}-<pid>-* dirs. Holds the shared,
                  platform-independent primitives (process_is_alive via
                  libc::kill(pid,0)→ESRCH; pid_from_tagged; for_each_stale);
                  per-module reap_stale fns live next to each module's
                  shutdown_cleanup (rdpdr/surface.rs, file_promise*.rs). Only
                  DEAD-pid, non-self dirs are reaped, so it's safe with another
                  instance live. Called once from async_main on a detached thread
                  (a stale umount can't block startup).
src/health.rs     Health-check watchdog (Tier 2.5) — turns a hung-but-alive
                  process into a clean exit so launchd KeepAlive restarts a fresh
                  one (KeepAlive only
                  catches an outright crash, not a wedge). A dedicated OS thread
                  (NOT a tokio task, so it ticks even when the runtime is wedged)
                  submits a trivial probe onto the tokio runtime each interval and
                  waits a bounded time; a deadlocked runtime never runs it, and
                  after N consecutive misses it process::exits with code 70. Pure,
                  unit-tested decision + parsing (should_arm / HealthConfig); armed
                  from async_main on the long-lived launchd-watched process,
                  skipped (by default) interactively (stdout a TTY).
                  Conservative defaults (15s interval / 30s timeout / 2 misses ⇒
                  ~90s to bounce). Env: MACRDP_HEALTHCHECK=0/1 +
                  MACRDP_HEALTHCHECK_{INTERVAL_SECS,TIMEOUT_SECS,FAILURES}
                  (config.env HEALTH_CHECK / HEALTHCHECK_*). Cross-platform.
src/usb_redirect/ Generic USB redirection (MS-RDPEUSB / URBDRC), the SERVER /
  mod.rs          presenting side (--enable-usb-redirection, EXPERIMENTAL, opt-in,
  usb_spike.m     macOS-only, needs the entitled build). The client redirects a
                  physical USB device and macrdp presents it as a REAL local device
                  via a user-space virtual USB host controller (public IOUSBHost
                  UserHCI / IOUSBHostControllerInterface — the entitlement
                  com.apple.developer.usb.host-controller-interface). mod.rs is the
                  cross-platform policy: the MacUsb UrbdrcServerFactory + drive_device
                  (dedups one controller per physical device on VID:PID:bcdDevice —
                  the client can double-announce one drive) + the async driver loop
                  that answers the macOS kernel's EP0 GET_DESCRIPTOR / control-OUT and
                  the bulk-endpoint transfers by driving the device's UsbHandle over
                  URBDRC. usb_spike.m is the quarantined Obj-C / IOUSBHost SPI boundary
                  (the UserHCI command/doorbell state machine + async out-of-band
                  transfer completion hopping onto the interface's serial queue; also
                  the standalone --usb-spike synthetic-device path). The URBDRC server
                  processor + UsbHandle transfer path (get_descriptor / bulk_transfer

                  ironrdp-server (src/rdpeusb.rs, divergence 16). VERIFIED end-to-end
                  on a real Linux FreeRDP client: a redirected flash drive mounts on

src/camera/       Camera redirection (MS-RDPECAM) — presents the CLIENT's webcam as a
  mod.rs          REAL macOS camera (--enable-camera-redirection, opt-in, default OFF,
  decode.rs       macOS-only). SHIPPED v0.9.0; as far as is known the first OSS RDP
  feed.rs         *server* to do this, and the path that works for mstsc (which routes
                  webcams over MS-RDPECAM and refuses the raw-USB reads the
                  usb_redirect path would need). mod.rs is the cross-platform policy:
                  the MacCamera RdCameraServerFactory + the CameraSink that receives
                  negotiated media types + H.264 samples (plus the opt-in
                  MACRDP_CAMERA_DUMP diagnostics). decode.rs is the VideoToolbox
                  VTDecompressionSession — Annex-B access units reframed to AVCC and
                  decoded to 420v (NV12) CVPixelBuffers; all CoreMedia/VT FFI is
                  quarantined there. feed.rs is the CoreMediaIO CLIENT: it finds the
                  virtual device by kCMIODevicePropertyDeviceUID, opens the extension's
                  SINK stream, and enqueues each decoded CVPixelBuffer wrapped in a
                  CMSampleBuffer — IOSurface-backed, so the handoff to the extension
                  process is ZERO-COPY. (Pick the sink by stream NAME: the direction
                  property is INVERTED vs its docs, and starting the wrong stream
                  returns SUCCESS while nothing ever drains — see
                  docs/camera-extension-setup.md.) The MS-RDPECAM state machine
                  (enumerator -> per-device channel -> ActivateDevice -> StreamList ->
                  media-type negotiation -> StartStreams -> the SampleRequest/
                  SampleResponse pull loop) lives in the vendored ironrdp-server
                  (src/rdcamera.rs, divergence 19). The virtual camera itself is a
                  separate process: gui/Sources/macrdpcamera (see the gui note above).

                          released.

vendor/ironrdp-acceptor/  Local fork of ironrdp-acceptor 0.8.0 (added
                          2026-06-12, same upstream rev as the git pins).
                          Two divergences: (1) honor_client_desktop_size —
                          adopt the client's requested desktop size from its
                          GCC Client Core Data BEFORE Demand Active, which
                          is what powers the default client-resolution
                          auto-adopt (--no-client-resolution opts out); and
                          (2) expose the client's keyboard-layout id (KLID)
                          from the same core data on AcceptorResult, which
                          powers default non-US keyboard auto-detect (the
                          vendor server publishes it; input.rs auto-selects
                          the layout). See vendor/ironrdp-acceptor/CLAUDE.md
                          and the client-resolution / keyboard-layout quirk
                          notes for why these can't be done from server code.

vendor/ironrdp-rdpdr/     Local fork of ironrdp-rdpdr 0.5.0 (added 2026-06-16,
                          same upstream rev). Upstream is client-only
                          (SvcClientProcessor); the fork adds the
                          server-direction decode halves the PDUs lack
                          (ClientName/DeviceListAnnounce/DeviceAnnounceHeader)
                          so a server can read what the client sends. The
                          server-side RdpdrServer processor itself lives in
                          vendor/ironrdp-server/src/rdpdr.rs. See
                          vendor/ironrdp-rdpdr/CLAUDE.md.

(vendor/ironrdp-rdpeusb/  DE-VENDORED at the a5d1c682 pin bump (v0.9.5, 2026-08-06).
                          The lenient UsbDeviceCaps decode (USB 3.x SupportedUsbVer +
                          Other(u32) fallbacks) landed upstream, so the MS-RDPEUSB /
                          URBDRC PDU crate is now the plain a5d1c682 git dependency
                          (Cargo.toml), not a fork. The server-direction USB-redirection
                          processor + the async UsbHandle transfer path that USE those
                          PDUs still live in the vendored ironrdp-server (src/rdpeusb.rs,
                          divergence 16) — that IS --enable-usb-redirection; only the
                          PDU-layer fork went away. If you're seeing this in a stale
                          checkout, the dir isn't missing — it stopped existing.)

vendor/ironrdp-rdpeudp/   NEW sans-I/O crate (added 2026-06-25) for RDP UDP
                          multitransport (--enable-udp-multitransport, feature
                          `multitransport`, default OFF). No sockets/tokio: PDU
                          codecs for RDPEUDP v1 (pdu.rs, big-endian) + RDPEUDP2
                          (eudp2.rs) + the MS-RDPEMT tunnel PDUs (emt.rs), and the
                          reliable transport state machine (state.rs: handshake +
                          in-order dedup delivery + cumulative-ACK + RTO retransmit)
                          driven by the listener. Candidate for upstream. See
                          vendor/ironrdp-rdpeudp/CLAUDE.md.

vendor/ironrdp-dvc/       Local fork of ironrdp-dvc 0.5.0 (added 2026-06-26, 4th
                          fork). Adds the server-direction MS-RDPEDYC **Soft-Sync**
                          codec (SoftSyncRequest/Response PDUs + the client
                          Soft-Sync-Response decode arm) so the server can move a
                          DVC (EGFX) onto the UDP tunnel and not tear down on the
                          client's reply. Patch wiring is TWO-SIDED (it's a path dep
                          of the git-pinned ironrdp crates) — see its CLAUDE.md.
                          Soft-Sync rides drdynvc on the MAIN TCP connection; only
                          channel data after the switch rides the UDP tunnel.

Cross-cutting:
- **TLS** terminates inside the acceptor; `rustls` with, by default, a self-signed cert at `~/Library/Application Support/macrdp/{cert,key}.pem` (generated on first run, persisted thereafter for stable client TOFU). **An operator can supply a real CA / ACME cert via `--cert`/`--key` (or `TLS_CERT`/`TLS_KEY`)** — `make_tls_acceptor` then loads exactly those PEM files and never silently self-signs (a missing/bad file is a hard error; it also warns at startup if the cert is expired / within 14 days). Both the self-signed and operator paths flow through the same `load_pem_cert_and_key` → so the rest is identical. `RdpServerSecurity::Hybrid` is used so the negotiation response advertises CredSSP — the public-key bytes handed to ironrdp are the raw `subjectPublicKey` BIT STRING from the X.509 cert (not the SPKI sequence, not the keypair-derived bytes), since that's what sspi hashes client-side. The same loaded cert/key also secure the UDP multitransport (TLS for the reliable flow, DTLS for the lossy flow), so operator certs apply there too.
- **Auth** at startup: `--username` (defaults to `$USER`) + interactive password prompt → PAM `checkpw` service → set as the static credential ironrdp_server checks per-connection. `--skip-auth` bypasses for dev.
- **Session model** — by default macrdp attaches to the console session of the logged-in user (single session, mirrors the primary panel). With `--virtual-display --width W --height H`, the server instead allocates a headless `CGVirtualDisplay` and serves *that*; the local Mac screen is untouched and the remote sees its own desktop at the requested resolution. The CG-side display is owned by `main()`'s scope, registered via `[CGVirtualDisplay initWithDescriptor:]` + `applySettings:`, and torn down on normal exit (signal-driven `std::process::exit(0)` skips Drop, but macOS reaps the registration when the owning process dies). Capture / input / cursor all parameterize on `(displayID, origin_pts, size_pts)` so they target the right surface regardless of which path is in effect.
- **Process model — single-process.** One `macrdp` process does everything (accept → capture/encode/serve) for the lifetime of the server. Under launchd it IS the job (KeepAlive watches it). It owns all persistent state directly: the virtual display, headless blanking (`--capture-primary`/`--detach-primary`, engaged on first connect, process-scoped so it auto-restores on process death), `caffeinate`, and the app-switcher HUD helper. (An earlier `--fork-workers` model that fork+exec'd a fresh worker process per connection — xrdp's model, to dodge mstsc's EGFX reconnect-blank — was removed once the server learned to self-heal that blank in place via a bare core Deactivation–Reactivation; see the H.264 reconnect-blank quirk.)
- **Signal handling** — `main.rs` spawns a task that awaits SIGINT/SIGTERM and `std::process::exit(0)`s. Without it, ScreenCaptureKit's framework threads can leave the process unkillable by Ctrl-C once an SCStream is active.
- **Audio rate** — SCK only supports 8/16/24/48 kHz, so capture is at 48 kHz, but `src/audio.rs` resamples to 44.1 kHz via `rubato` before sending. The 44.1 kHz output is **empirically load-bearing** — the earlier 48 kHz feed produced a ~20% sustained over-feed and multi-second audio backlogs on mstsc, and switching to 44.1 fixed it — but the originally-documented mechanism ("the client plays directly without internal resampling") was checked against Microsoft's Core Audio docs (2026-07-18) and doesn't hold in general: modern Windows resamples *every* shared-mode stream to the endpoint's configured mix format (frequently 48 kHz) regardless, so the honest explanation for the historical backlog is a rate-accounting/pacing mismatch in the old 48 kHz path, not avoided resampling. Don't revert to 48 kHz without re-testing the mstsc backlog; don't cite "no client resampling" as the reason. The advertised RDPSND `AudioFormat` is 44.1 kHz / 2 ch / 16-bit.
- **Single capture loop** — `MacRdpsnd` (the audio factory) holds an `Arc<AtomicU64>` generation counter shared with every backend it builds. Each `start()` claims a fresh generation; older capture loops observe the bump on their next iteration and exit. Without this, an mstsc cert-prompt reconnect leaves the first capture loop running while the second starts, both feeding the shared event channel → ~2× audio reaching the client.

When adding a feature, locate it in one of those modules first; if it spans them (e.g., a new virtual channel), it belongs in a dedicated module alongside `clipboard.rs`, driven by `ironrdp_server`'s factory traits.
