//! H.264 / EGFX video pipeline (app side).
//!
//! Rewritten from scratch after `h264-attempt-1` (which negotiated EGFX but
//! never rendered correctly). The salvaged VideoToolbox encoder lives in
//! `src/videotoolbox.rs`; this module bridges it to upstream's
//! `GraphicsPipelineServer` via the vendored `GfxServerFactory` hooks.
//!
//! Flow — two decoupled threads (the "push model"):
//!
//!   Capture thread (`submit_bgra`, once per SCK frame):
//!     1. First call lazily creates the EGFX surface + VT encoder AND spawns the
//!        ship thread (not in `on_ready`, which holds the server mutex).
//!     2. Drop-to-latest throttle: if `submitted - shipped` ≥
//!        `--h264-frames-in-flight`, skip this capture. Bounds latency under
//!        load without relying on frame acks (clients commonly suspend them).
//!        Skipping a capture *before* encode doesn't break the reference chain.
//!     3. Otherwise `Encoder::encode_bgra` submits to VideoToolbox (async) and
//!        returns immediately — the capture thread never blocks on the encoder,
//!        so it keeps pace with ScreenCaptureKit instead of falling behind under
//!        heavy frames (which would queue stale frames → growing latency).
//!
//!   Ship thread (`ship_loop`):
//!     4. Blocks on VT's output channel; for each encoded frame, frames it (see
//!        `WireFormat`), hands it to `GraphicsPipelineServer::send_avc420_frame`
//!        (StartFrame / WireToSurface1 / EndFrame), then ships the resulting
//!        `DvcMessage`s through DRDYNVC via `ServerEvent::Egfx(SendMessages)`,
//!        and bumps `shipped`.
//!
//!   The EGFX send window is `u32::MAX` (see `GfxHandler::max_frames_in_flight`)
//!   so `send_avc420_frame` NEVER drops an encoded frame — dropping one (a
//!   P-frame, or worse a keyframe) breaks the H.264 reference chain and causes
//!   client-side artifacts. All throttling is the capture-side drop above.
//!
//!   (Earlier this was single-threaded with a blocking `drain_wait`; that
//!   serialized capture with encode and fell behind under load. See memory
//!   h264-latency-tuning.)
//!
//! ## The bitstream-format question (see memory: avc420-bitstream-format-trap)
//!
//! VideoToolbox emits **AVCC** (4-byte big-endian length-prefixed NALs), with
//! SPS/PPS out-of-band. The AVC420 wire payload can be either AVCC
//! (length-prefixed) or Annex-B (start codes). ironrdp's own decoder expects
//! length-prefixed, but **Microsoft's mstsc decoder requires Annex-B** — this
//! was settled empirically 2026-05-20: mstsc renders with Annex-B, but with
//! length-prefixed it never sends a single frame-ack and the surface stays
//! blank. So we DEFAULT to Annex-B and keep length-prefixed one env var away
//! (`MACRDP_H264_LENGTH_PREFIXED=1`) for ironrdp-decoder interop testing.
