//! Reconnect awareness for `--lock-on-disconnect`.
//!
//! The lock fires once no session has been live for the safety buffer. But a
//! session only counts as live once it is FULLY connected, which over a
//! VPN/ZeroTier link takes ~10 s — so a client that reconnects late in the
//! buffer is locked underneath its own handshake (live-observed on #181; with
//! `--auto-unlock` it self-corrects, without it the remote user is stranded).
//!
//! This module notices connection activity that happens AFTER the disconnect
//! and lets the lock wait for it to resolve:
//!
//! - an **authenticated** reconnect (CredSSP succeeded) holds the lock until it
//!   finishes connecting — only someone who knows the password can do that;
//! - a merely **accepted** connection (still in TLS/CredSSP) holds it briefly,
//!   because the timer can end mid-CredSSP too.
//!
//! Every hold is capped by [`MAX_HOLD`] from the moment the lock would have
//! fired, so an unauthenticated peer opening connections can delay the lock
//! by at most that much — never prevent it.
//!
//! Only installed with `--lock-on-disconnect`; the default connection path is
//! unchanged (no wrapper, no timestamps).
