//! Windows→Mac file clipboard download + NSPasteboard publication.
//!
//! Originally tried via `NSFilePromiseProvider` so Finder could lazy-fetch
//! on paste, but Finder's Cmd-V does NOT invoke `NSFilePromiseReceiver`
//! (it's a drag-and-drop-only path); paste reads `NSPasteboardTypeFileURL`
//! directly and beeps when the URL is missing. So we eagerly download the
//! file bytes to a per-paste temp directory in `/tmp` the moment Windows
//! announces the copy, then publish the temp paths as real file URLs on
//! the pasteboard. Finder's paste then does a normal `cp` from /tmp to
//! the destination.
//!
//! Trade-offs vs. the promise approach:
//! - Network + disk happen eagerly even if the user never pastes. Cost is
//!   bounded by the cap in `clipboard.rs::MAX_INCOMING_PAYLOAD` analog
//!   (we don't enforce one yet — Phase 3 should add it).
//! - Finder paste is instantaneous once the temp file exists.
//! - Temp files outlive the paste; we clean them up on the next remote
//!   copy and on process exit. Stale files in `/tmp` are fine until then.
//!
//! Threading: download tasks run on the tokio runtime captured at
//! `on_remote_file_list` time. The `cocoa` helper in this module writes
//! to NSPasteboard from whichever thread the calling task is on —
//! NSPasteboard's API is documented thread-safe.
