# Fork context (read first)

- This repo is a fork of clintcan/macrdp. The target architecture is in `docs/superpowers/specs/2026-09-29-negotiated-mac-rdp-design.md`; the active plan is under `docs/superpowers/plans/`.
- Record every deliberate difference from upstream code in `FORK.md` → Divergence log.
- Guiding rule: sessions are configured by negotiation with the client, not flags. New code must not add user-facing flags.
- Performance and color accuracy are hard requirements (spec §8, §9).
- Upstream's own guidance follows unchanged.

# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

> Layout note: this file is a lean index. The rules-and-gotchas docs are pulled in via
> `@import` below and load every session; the reference docs load ON DEMAND — read the
> matching one before working in its area. Keep each topic file self-contained and add
> new long-form material to the matching file rather than growing this one.
> - `@docs/macos-gotchas.md` — TCC, CGVirtualDisplay, QoS, activation (always loaded)
> - `@docs/known-quirks.md` — hard-won client/codec/audio behavioural notes (always loaded)
> - `@docs/conventions.md` — conventions worth keeping when adding code (always loaded)
> - `docs/features.md` — what works today, per-feature caveats. Read before changing or
>   describing a feature's behaviour.
> - `docs/architecture.md` — module map + cross-cutting design (TLS, auth, session and
>   process model, audio rate). Read before adding a module or touching a cross-cutting path.
> - `docs/cli.md` — build/run/test commands, the full CLI flag + env-var reference.
>   Read before adding or changing a flag, or when a command/tunable is needed.
> - `docs/oss-rdp-server-comparison.md` — the verified evidence behind the "first OSS
>   RDP server to…" claims (and what NOT to claim). Read before repeating any of them.

> The `vendor/ironrdp-*/` forks each have their own nested `CLAUDE.md` (the
> divergence logs) that load only when you work inside those directories.

## Status

Functional v0 — daily-driver usable on a trusted LAN and over the internet
(VPN/ZeroTier). **Latest release: v0.9.9** (rich-text clipboard, #189). Unreleased on
`main`: #190 (`--lock-on-disconnect` holds while a reconnect is handshaking).
**Per-release detail — what shipped, what was verified live, the war stories — lives in
`docs/release-history.md`; read it before reasoning about when/why something changed.**
Release cuts update that file, the README status line, and this Status line.

## Project goal

A native RDP server for macOS written in Rust on top of [`ironrdp`](https://github.com/Devolutions/IronRDP). Functionally analogous to `xrdp` on Linux: Windows / cross-platform RDP clients connect to the Mac and see its desktop, with keyboard/mouse forwarded back.

Not a client, not a VNC bridge, not a proxy — the server terminates the RDP protocol itself and renders/feeds the local macOS session.
